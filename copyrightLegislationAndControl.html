    <h1>Data Protection Act 1998</h1>
    <p>The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988) is the UK law that gives
	an individual or organisation the right to control a piece of original work.
	The Act applies equally to digital content, such as music and movies, as it
	does to content in other forms, such as a painting or piece of sheet music.
	Software licences are used to indicate to the user how the software can be used.
	At an advanced level you can learn about the way digital content can be
	protected through the use of rights management and software activation.</p>

    <h4 onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown)"><u>Main Principles</u></h4>
    <div id="dropdown" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown')">
        <p>The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988) is legislation that allows 
		an individual or organisation that has created a piece of original work, e.g.
		a book or painting, the right to control the use of their work. The ownerâ€™s
		rights cover the way that the work can be used, e.g. copying, adapting, 
		broadcasting, or lending. The legislation covers:
		<ul>
			<li>Literary works</li>
			<li>Dramatic works</li>
			<li>Musical works</li>
			<li>Artistic works</li>
			<li>Typographical works</li>
			<li>Sound recordings</li>
			<li>Films</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Digital assets have the same protection as those produced in traditional form. The work does not have to be labelled as copyright.</p>
		<p>The Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 extended the Act to cover computer programs.</p>
		<p>Most work is protected by copyright law for 70 years after the death of the author or composer, although some categories have shorter protection periods, including broadcasts (50 years) and computer-generated work (50 years).</p>
		<p>A <strong>patent</strong> allows an original idea (within certain fields) to be protected. The shape or configuration of a product or item is protected by <strong>design rights</strong>. A <strong>trademark</strong> protects indications (e.g. a logo) of the commercial source of a product or service and remain in force as long as they are actively used or registered.</p>
		<p>In this video, the creator and founder of Raspberry Pi, Eben Upton, discusses how trademarks allow him to defend the Raspberry Pi brand.</p>

	<h4 onclick="toggleDropdown()"><u>Software Licenses</u></h4>
    <div id="dropdown2" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown2')">
        <p>Developers release software under a licence.
		Software users do not own the software, but they are permitted to use it if 
		they agree to the licence terms. The licence may, or may not, place
		restrictions on the user.
		Software that does not place restrictions on users is known as free software.
		Free software gives users the freedom to run, study, distribute, and modify 
		the software. Nearly all open-source software is free software, but there are 
		exceptions. For example, some open-source software does not give users the 
		to make a modified version and then use it privately, meaning it cannot be 
		classified as free software.</p>
		
		<p><br>Software is said to be proprietary if it is non-free, meaning there are 
			restrictions placed on the user. Examples of these restrictions include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Limiting the number of computers on which the software can be used (often through the use of activation keys)</li>
			<li>Specifying types of usage; for example, non-commercial, educational, or non-profit use</li>
			<li>Not providing users with the ability to study or modify the source code 
			(some proprietary software provides access to the source code, but restricts
			users from distributing their modifications to the source code)</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown3')"><u>Creative Commons</u></h4>
    <div id="dropdown3" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown3')">
        <p>Computer networks and especially the internet have made it
		very easy to share files. Whilst this helps authors who wish to 
		share their work, it is not good for authors whose work is copied 
		and/or shared illegally.
		Some people think that because something is freely accessible on the internet,
		it can be copied legally. However, this is not true. To use material that is 
		protected by the legislation, you need to have permission. This may be freely
		given, or the owner may insist on being named as the creator or owner of the 
		copyright. A Creative Commons licence allows the owner to be attributed, or 
		choose how others can share, use, or build on the material.</p>

	</div>
	
			<h4 onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown4')"><u>Digital Rights Management</u></h4>
    <div id="dropdown4" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown4')">
        <p>Piracy is the illegal copying of software or data (e.g. movies)
		without regard to copyright. The internet has made the distribution 
		of pirated materials much easier to achieve, and harder for law 
		enforcement agencies to detect.</p>
		<p><br> Most modern content producers often employ some form of digital 
		rights management (DRM) to prevent unauthorised distribution of their 
		material. DRM is a set of access control tools that can limit the time 
		period in which the material can be used (e.g. when renting a movie online),
		the number of devices it can be used upon, or prevent the copying of the data
		altogether. Some video games have famously included code to detect when 
		a pirate copy of the game is being played and to cause strange things to 
		happen within the game to inconvenience the player. For example, the 2000
		video game Spyro: Year of the Dragon used checksums on the game data to check
		if it was a pirate copy. If piracy was detected, it caused the player
		to randomly teleport to different places in the game and to be forced to
		repeat levels that had been previously completed.</p>
