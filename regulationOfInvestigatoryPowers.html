    <h4 onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown)"><u>Main Principles</u></h4>
    <div id="dropdown" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown')">
        <p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) was needed because 
		of the growth in internet communications. It lays out the limits of police 
		and government agencies' powers, and the responsibilities of companies such 
		as internet service providers (ISPs), telecom companies, and social media
		platforms.
		</p>

		<p>It was enacted in 2000 and has been amended multiple times since then,
		most recently in 2016. The Act is controversial â€” it was recently amended 
		by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which was nicknamed the "Snoopers' 
		Charter" by privacy campaigners because it added sweeping new powers,
		including the bulk collection of data. Supporters of the legislation claim
		that it is largely bringing the online world into line with the 'real world'.
		</p>
		<h1> Provisions of the Act</h1>
		<p>
		Under the Act, the police and specified public bodies can,
		with appropriate authorisation:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Demand that internet service providers (ISPs) provide access to
			 their customers' digital communications, without informing the customer</li>
			<li>Carry out mass surveillance of digital communications</li>
			<li>Demand that ISPs fit equipment to allow for digital surveillance</li>
			<li>Demand that someone hand over the keys to encrypted information</li>
			<li>Intercept and monitor ongoing digital communication</li>
			<li>Keep secret the existence of interception warrants and any data 
			collected under them, even from being revealed in court</li>		
		</ul>
